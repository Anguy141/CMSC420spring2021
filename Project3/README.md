# Programming Assignment 3: Efficient TSP Heuristics

# Overview: 
In this assignment we will combine our extended AA tree and wrapped kd-tree data
structures to implement a data structure for maintaining traveling salesperson (TSP) tours.
We are given a discrete set of points P in R
2
. Recall from Programming Assignment 0 that
a tour of P is a cycle that visits all the points of P exactly once.
